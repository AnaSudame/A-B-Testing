# A-B-Testing
This is the second main project I did as a Student at the Udacity while pursing Nanodegree DataAnalyst Progarm.
This project performs A/B testing to undertsand the results run by an e-commerce website where in some users are presented with 
old design of a webpage and some are treated with a new design. Based on the experiment results, we perform hypotheses tests and use
bootstrapping to analyse the results. In the second part the same analyses is carried out using Logistic regression.
